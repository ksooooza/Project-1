# Project-1

My game is named (K)Wordle, meaning Katherine's Wordle, a play off of the popular New York Times game, Wordle.

The original Wordle game was created by software engineer Joshua Wardle of Brooklyn for his girlfriend Palak.
It was created in October of 2021 - by November 1 of 2021, 90 people were playing it. By Sunday January 2, 2022, just over two months later, 300,000 people were playing it.

On January 31, 2022 the New York Times bought Wordle and it is now one of the most popular games on the internet!


MY code for this project was written in Javascript for gameplay with HTML and CSS for content and styling.

Lucky us! We won the (K)Wordle




Some of the bigger challenges I faced:
-Figuring out how to compare the user input guess to the randomly generated answer word
-Figuring out how to collect the guesses IN ORDER
-Writing a backspace function so that it would move through each input box on the backspace key when a user deleted their answer before submission
